Just like that, it was [over for the Michigan State Spartans and the Michigan Wolverines.](http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140331/SPORTS0201/303310044/Shattered-dreams-U-M-MSU-eliminated)  One ugly loss and one spectacular one--but both games were just as close and just as heart wrenching.

But as two seasons end, two begin.  Opening day for the Tigers marks the 15th opener at CoPa and signifies that we've made it through the polar vortex into the season of spring.  Part of me thought this bitch of a winter would be passed straight to summer but it appears we will have a spring after all.  So Spartan and Wolverine fans, don't feel too sorry for yourself we have baseball and sunshine...  Go Tigers!
