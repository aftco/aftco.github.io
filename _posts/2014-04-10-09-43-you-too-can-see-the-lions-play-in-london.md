For the low, low price of $2715, you'll be flown to London, get three nights in the Hilton Park Lane hotel and an upper deck ticket to watch the Lions play the Falcons. While this _is_ London--one of the more expensive cities in the world--the price is firmly out of reach for many Lions fans. Taking a broader view, it's hard to see how these international games are good for anyone besides the NFL and its owners. The travel is rough on the players and the game actually _counts as a home game_ for one of the teams. Not to mention the fact that they freeze out the average fan through high costs and distant travel. 

But, if you can afford it, act fast. These Superbowl-sized prices won't be around forever.
