Detroit Tiger fans may need to start coming to terms with Iglesias not being ready for opening day.  Per manager, Brad Ausmus:

>We're going to hit that point in spring training where there won't be enough games for him to get at-bats to get ready.

It's too early to panic but brace yourself for a heavy dose of Steve Lombardozzi...
