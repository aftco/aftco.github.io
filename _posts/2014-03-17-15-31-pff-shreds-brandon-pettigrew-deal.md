The RSS teaser for this story orginally read:

>The big, slow, free agent tight end has agreed to stay with his current Detroit Lions. Will a new contract and coaching staff change his fantasy football value?

I love PFF breakdowns but I hope Nate Hodges is dead wrong on his latest story.  Time for Pettigrew to step up in a big way.
