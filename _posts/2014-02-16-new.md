By all accounts it seems Ndamukong Suh holds all the cards in contract negotiations.   Pair that with his recent high profile agent change, the Lions are in a tough spot.  

Even with dead money in excess of $9m on the horizon, it might be time to let Suh's ridiculous contract expire and finally get the salary cap under control...
