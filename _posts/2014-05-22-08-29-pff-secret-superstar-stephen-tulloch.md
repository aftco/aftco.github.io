>PFF’s Secret Superstar series serves to highlight young emerging players, as well as consistently quality players still flying under the radar. Few players personify the latter better than Detroit’s Stephen Tulloch. The middle linebacker has graded out in the top 10 for middle linebackers two of the past three seasons with just one negatively graded season in the PFF era and still fails to get mentioned (or paid) as one of the best at the position.
