Sammy Watkins seems to like the idea of being a Lion. In an interview with FOXSports.com, Watkins called the prospect of playing along side Megatron and Golden Tate "crazy".

>“You wouldn’t be able to double-guard Megatron. You wouldn’t be able to double-guard me. Basically it would be pick your poison and then you have Golden Tate in the slot. He runs nice routes and is a very physical guy. Then you have Reggie Bush in the backfield. There would be a lot of speed in that offense.

>“That’s the type of offense that I want to play in. It’s a very explosive offense. Being with good coaches, an older wide receiver and a quarterback would definitely help me out a lot.”
