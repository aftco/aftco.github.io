If the NFL is looking for some sizzle, sending Jim Schwartz back to Ford Field on Thanksgiving should provide it.  It is rumored that the Lions will host the Bills on Thanksgiving marking the Bills first turkey day game since 1994.  

The Lions mauled the Packers by 30 last year.  Just had to throw that in there.
