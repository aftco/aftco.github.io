Huge game Michigan / Michigan State game today, with the top spot in the B1G on the line:

> There are always bragging rights on the line when these teams meet, but when No. 20 Michigan hosts No. 13 Michigan State on Sunday, a lot more will be at stake. The Wolverines trail the Spartans by a half-game atop the Big Ten standings, so the race for the conference title could swing significantly this weekend.

If you can't catch the game on TV, [CBS has the game online for free](http://cbssports.com).
