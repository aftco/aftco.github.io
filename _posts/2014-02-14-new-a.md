Darius Slay will be working on perfecting his craft with HOF CB, Rod Woodson.  Slay showed flashes of what he's capable of last season but was far too inconsistent to be much more than a wild card going into the 2014 season.  That said, most rookie DBs have a shaky transition from college to the pros and maybe this extra work can help propel Slay to the next level.  Fans should at least appreciate the effort.
