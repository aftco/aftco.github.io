Grey Papke of Walkoff Woodward:

>Detroit completed a 6-1 road trip against three division rivals with a convincing sweep of the Royals, averaging nearly seven runs per game over those seven games. The rotation posted a 3.07 ERA on the trip and the lineup now boasts the best team batting average in the AL. With the Astros and Twins set to come in on the next homestand, the Tigers could be poised to go on a major roll.
