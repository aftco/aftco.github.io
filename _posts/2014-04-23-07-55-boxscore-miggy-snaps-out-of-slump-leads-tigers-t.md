Miguel Cabrera and Alex Avila had both been mired in frustrating slumps.  It had gotten so bad for Avila that he was well below the [Mendoza line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendoza_Line) batting .174 going into last night.  Luckily for these Tigers' bats, they were facing an arm that was forced into action due to Chris Sale heading to the DL.

Cabrera went 3-5 with 3 RBIs and a home run.  Avila went 3-4 with an RBI.  

Hopefully this is a sign that the Tigers' sluggers are about to snap out of their respective slumps and return closer to their career averages.
