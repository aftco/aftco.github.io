This Spring just keeps getting weirder:

>Lombardozzi, 25, hit .259/.278/.338 in 307 plate appearances for the Nationals last year, appearing at second base, left field, and third base.  He was traded to the Tigers in December along with Robbie Ray and Ian Krol for Doug Fister.  Gonzalez, 37, was in Orioles camp as a non-roster invitee.  Gonzalez had signed a minor league deal with Baltimore in January, and put together a strong line in 30 spring plate appearances.
