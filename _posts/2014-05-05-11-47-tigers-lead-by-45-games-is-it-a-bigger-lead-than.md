The guys at BlessYouBoys.com compare the Tigers lead to the NHL point system:

>The lead this morning is 4.5 games over second-place Minnesota, but more important is the games played. Let's use a hockey analogy. The pucksters like to talk a lot about "games in hand." If this was the NHL, the Tigers, with their 17 wins, would have 34 points. The Twins, with 14 wins, would have 28 points. But here's the rub. The Tigers have played three fewer games than Minnesota. In hockey, if you had a six-point lead over a team with three games in hand, you'd be pretty darned happy, eh?
