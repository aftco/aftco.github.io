It seemed like a sure bet this time last week that James Ihedigbo would wind up with the Lions but with the recent news that the Ravens are back in the mix, the Lions front office is covering their bases. Thomas Decoud is an interesting name because he went from a pro bowler with age on his side to an unwanted commodity in just one season.  If Decoud can return to his 2012 form the Lions could get him for an excellent value.
