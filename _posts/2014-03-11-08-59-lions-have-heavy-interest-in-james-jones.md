A clear need for the Lions this free agency period is wide receiver and veteran James Jones fits the Lions mold.  Jones has the ability to work underneath and is an excellent route runner.  Overpaying for Jones would be a mistake but if they could sign him for significantly less than a guy like Emmanuel Sanders, this would be a no brainer.
