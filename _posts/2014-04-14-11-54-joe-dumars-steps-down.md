Kind of an odd "break":

> The Joe Dumars drama isn't so dramatic after all: He didn't quit, nor did the Detroit Pistons terminate him, but rather the iconic former player and current president of basketball operations has agreed to stay with the team in a non-basketball operations role.
>The Pistons have not made any announcement but sources said Dumars has agreed to an advisory role within the organization.

I love Joey D, but given the number of bad moves he's made over his time as GM, I would have thought a separation was warranted.
