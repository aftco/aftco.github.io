Kyle Meinke of MLive.com breaks down the cap implications of the latest contracts:

>The Detroit Lions took on another $2.25 million in cap space Friday to re-sign starting tight end Brandon Pettigrew.  Detroit also signed Golden Tate and Joique Bell to long-term deals this week. That trio will count $7.65 million against the $133 million cap for 2014.
