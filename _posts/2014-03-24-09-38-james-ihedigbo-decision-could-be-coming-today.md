[PrideOfDetroit.com](http://www.prideofdetroit.com) speculates that free agent safety James Ihedigbo's decision to stay in Baltimore or take the starting job in Detroit could be coming today:

>The Free Press' Dave Birkett reports that Ihedigbo was offered a two-year deal by the Lions at the time, and Birkett also reports that Ihedigbo may be close to making a decision. It appears that his decision could come as early as Monday, meaning the Lions may be able to finally move forward at safety.
