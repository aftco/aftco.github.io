Todd McShay has a new version of his mock draft up at ESPN and has the Lions taking wide receiver Mike Evans in the first round. He reasons that the depth of the field at corner back allows the Lions to wait on that position and take a wide receiver in the first round. But couldn't the same be said of the field of wide receivers? The Lions have a lot of good choices available and it'll be interesting to see which direction they go in the first couple rounds.
