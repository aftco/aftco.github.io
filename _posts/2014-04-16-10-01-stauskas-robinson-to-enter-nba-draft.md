It's official:

> Tuesday's departures stung the most, though they were expected.

> In one fell swoop, 30.6 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game are now gone from Michigan's 2013-14 roster. All told, Robinson and Stauskas accounted for 40.7 percent of the team's overall scoring last season. In their two years, Robinson and Stauskas notched 145 career starts and combined to play 65.9 minutes per game.

After the back and forth on whether or not Stauskas was going pro last week, moving on was clearly the right move for him.  Somewhat more surprising is Robinson going pro given the relative off year he had last season:

> The son of former 11-year NBA veteran Glenn Robinson, Glenn Robinson III was a preseason top-50 candidate for both the Wooden and the Naismith Award, but battled some inconsistencies through much of the season. Thriving as a slasher and a scorer, Robinson struggled to find his jumper. He made only 4-of-22 (18.2 percent) 3-pointers in 11 road games and shot 22.2 percent in Big Ten play.
