I found this great source for 2014 cap numbers for over at (OverTheCap.com)[http://overthecap.com/teamcap.php?Team=Lions&Year=2014].  Right off the bat a couple contracts stick out to me.  First off, let's whack Montell Owens and CJ Mosley for a savings of $2.7m.  Neither player contributed much last season and Montell Owens couldn't stay healthy.  Isn't Jeremy Ross his replacement anyway?

Also, if the Lions are able to find a future replacement for Dominic Raiola in the draft or free agency, another casualty could be Rob Simms for $2.5m though OG is not the deepest of positions on the Lions roster and you'd be losing $1.2m in dead money on Sims' contract.

The Lions don't have a ton of fat to trim but something needs to be done to bring back Pettigrew and/or Willie Young, find a number 2 at wide receiver and replace Delmas in the secondary.  Some of this can be done through the draft but is it prudent to count on a rookie?
