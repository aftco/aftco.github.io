Sam Genson (@Tigercub33), Walkoff Woodward:  
>The Tigers remain red hot after sweeping both the Orioles (at Camden Yards) and the Red Sox (at Fenway Park). It was the first time since 1983 that the Tigers managed to sweep the Red Sox in Boston and they did so in convincing fashion. The pitching was simply dominant, allowing just 16 hits the entire series.
