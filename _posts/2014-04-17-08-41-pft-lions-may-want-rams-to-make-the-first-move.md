Mike Florio at PFT has an interesting theory on why the Lions have made it know they want to move up for Sammy Watkins:

>...it’s clear the Lions want to move up.  The question becomes how much it will cost.  The cost could be less if the Lions aren’t the ones to make the first move.  It’ll cost even less if the Lions can get two teams to bid against each other.
