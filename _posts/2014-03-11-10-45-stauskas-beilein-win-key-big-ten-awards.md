Big Ten year-end awards were handed out and Michigan won the 2 big ones:

* Nik Stauskas won the Big Ten Player of the Year award, the second consecutive year that a Michigan player won the award. Nick Baumgardner on mlive has a [good piece on Stauskas and his year](http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2014/03/column_nik_stauskas_will_as_mu.html).
* John Beilein split the Coach of the Year award, winning the media half. Nebraska coach Tim Miles won the coaches vote. Brendan Quinn on mlive [shows Beilein's humble demeanor](http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2014/03/twenty_years_later_john_beilei.html), also worth a read.
