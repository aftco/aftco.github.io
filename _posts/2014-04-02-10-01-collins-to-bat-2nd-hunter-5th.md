I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention in spring ball but this lineup change came as a surprise:

>With Collins batting second, outfielder Torii Hunter has been dropped to fifth in the lineup. It's a move he expected, as the Royals are running out left-handed starter Jason Vargas. Hunter said Saturday that he expects to bat second against righties and fifth in the lineup against southpaws.
