mlive also had a good write-up of the Pistons backs being against the wall trying to make the playoffs.  Couple of relavent quotes:

> Your president of basketball operations, Joe Dumars, is a lame duck.

I couldn't agree more, but Gores has the final say here and it looks like he's not willing to make a change. And:

> The Pistons knew the importance of the Charlotte back-to-back before they even left for All-Star break.
>
> They responded by losing both games by double-digit margins.

Certainly not heading the right direction, even with the coaching change..
