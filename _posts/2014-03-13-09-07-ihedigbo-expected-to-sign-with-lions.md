PFT is reporting that the Lions are close to signing the hard hitting, run stuffing safety, James Ihedigbo to fill the hole left when Delmas was cut.

>Per a league source, Ihedigbo is expected to sign with the Lions.  The move would reunite Ihedigbo, most recently a Raven, with former Ravens defensive backs coach Teryl Austin.  Lions coach Jim Caldwell hired Ihedigbo to coordinate the defense.
