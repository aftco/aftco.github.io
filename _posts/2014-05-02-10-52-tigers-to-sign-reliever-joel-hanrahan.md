In a move to bolster their slumping bull pen, the Tigers are closing in on a deal to sign veteran reliever and 2-time allstar, Joel Hanrahan:

>...Hanrahan posted a 2.59 ERA with 10.4 K/9, 3.8 BB/9 and 82 saves in 229 1/3 innings with the Pirates from 2009-12 before a trade that sent him to Boston last in the 2012-13 offseason. Hanrahan fits the Tigersâ€™ affinity for power arms, as his 96.5 mph average fastball from 2011-13 ranked seventh in the game among qualified relievers.
