The Lions refused to pay Willie Young the number he was looking for and now it appears he's headed to the Bears.  With Young gone the Lions will start Ziggy Ansah on the right side and either second year player, Devin Taylor or the more versatile Jason Jones on the left side.  Either way, look for Devin Taylor's playing time to spike dramatically.

Most experts believe the recent production out of the left side of the line (Avril and Young) was due to the allpro they play next to, Ndamukong Suh.  This theory will be put to the test in 2014.
