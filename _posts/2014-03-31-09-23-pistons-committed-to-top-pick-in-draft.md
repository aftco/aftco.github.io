One of the only teams in the NBA struggling more than the Pistons are the Sixers who had lost 26 straight games.  26 STRAIGHT LOSSES.  In case you were wondering, the record is 27 straight losses.

But the the Pistons would not be deterred from their chase of more lottery balls as they were blown out by 25.  They are really bad and hopefully it finally pays off when the lottery balls drop.
