Huge with by Michigan vaulting them into first place in the B1G and completing the season sweep against MSU.  The Wolverines trailed for most of the first half before blowing open a double digit lead early in the second half:> On Sunday, that game meant 20-plus point performances from both LeVert and Stauskas (the Wolverines are 3-0 when that happens), 15 points and a team-high five boards from Robinson. It also meant a clean game in which the Wolverines committed just three turnovers.(16) Michigan also moved ahead of (18) State in [this morning's updated AP poll](http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2014/02/ap_top_25_michigan_rides_win_o.html).[\[Box Score\]](http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=400510043)
