While making an appearance at Detroit's MGM casino, Lions president Tom Lewand shared his "win now" vision of the team. He also got a rare bit of public dissent from a local character identified only as "Big Steve". If you've been following the Lions closely there isn't much new here, but the interactions between Lewand and Big Steve are priceless.
