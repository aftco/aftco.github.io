PFF is rating the top 101 players in the NFL and 2 Lions were list from 61-70.

#67 Larry Warford:
>It normally takes mid round offensive linemen a bit of time to adjust to life in the NFL. Not so with Warford who looked like he belonged from Day 1, before really kicking into another gear as the season progressed. That would earn him our Rookie of the Year award as he showcased some punch in the run game, while holding up in pass protection, allowing just 15 quarterback disruptions all year. Some introduction to the league. Best Performance: Week 11, DET @ PIT, +5.9  Key Stat: Didn’t allow a single sack all year.

#62 Stephen Tulloch:
>One of those players who never seems to get his due. Tulloch is known as something of a thumper but since moving to Detroit he’s definitely expanded his skill set to become a very handy player to have on passing downs where he excels at keeping things in front of him and making tackles for short gains. Still, his work against the run shouldn’t be discounted as he proved again that he is one of the better linebackers in the league when it comes to getting off blocks and making plays.  Best Performance: Week 10, DET @ CHI, +6.1  Key Stat: His 40 defensive stops against the run were fifth-most of all inside linebackers.
