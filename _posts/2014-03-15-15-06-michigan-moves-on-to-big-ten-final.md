Michigan wins another tight game in the Big Ten Tourney.  With Villanova and Kansas both losing in their respective conference tournaments, Michigan may be looking to [move up to a 1 seed](http://www.bracketmatrix.com/). Depending on how Wisconsin fairs today against MSU (tip is in 10 minutes), they may have a pretty solid claim.
