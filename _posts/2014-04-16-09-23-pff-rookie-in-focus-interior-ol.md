PFF breaks down the performance of the NFL's rookie interior linemen class.  Despite the Bear's Kyle Long being "selected" to the pro bowl, Larry Warford outperformed him in every category.  PFF is not the definitive source for stats but they review every play and have a system for ranking the players whereas the pro bowl is a popularity contest and an NFL name like "Long" will always be chosen before a 2nd round road grader like Warford.  Oh well, PFF thinks the Lions have the better offensive guard.
