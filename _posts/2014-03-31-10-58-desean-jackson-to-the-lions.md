Jim Caldwell said the Lions "haven't discussed" acquiring recently released DeSean Jackson.  But he didn't exactly eliminate the possibility of him joining the Lions:

>We haven’t discussed him. I can say he’s a playmaker, a guy that can get it done.  At this point in time, we have not had any discussions.  In this business, you never say never.
