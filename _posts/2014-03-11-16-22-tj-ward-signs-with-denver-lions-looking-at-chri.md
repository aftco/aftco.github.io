Now that T.J. Ward has signed with the Denver Broncos, the Lions will have to look elsewhere for help at safety.  

ESPN's NFCN blogger, Michael Rothstein just tweeted that the Lions are looking at Chris Clemons to fill their vacancy.  PFF has him rated as the #4 best available safety, one spot in front of Louis Delmas.  Interestingly enough, Clemons played for Miami last season, the team that just picked up Delmas.  Safety swap?
