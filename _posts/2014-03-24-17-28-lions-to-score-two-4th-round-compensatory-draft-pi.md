It was reported in February that the Lions would be receiving a [4th round compensatory pick](http://www.prideofdetroit.com/2014/2/7/5390728/nfl-compensatory-picks-2014-lions) in this year's draft.  NFL Trade Rumors is now projecting another 4th round pick.

The more picks, the better when trying to sweeten the deal to trade up for Sammy Watkins.
