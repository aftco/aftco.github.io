The Tigers are on a roll right now but none of their shortstops are hitting.  Like, at all.

There is a guy in AA Erie that has hit at every level and plays a good SS; his name is Eugenio Suarez.  Suarez has an impressive slash line of .270/.336/.530 with good power (9 2Bs, 1 3B, 5 HRs and 19 RBIs).

If you see a AAA promotion this summer, expect the next move for Eugenio Suarez to be to the Tigers.  It makes perfect sense, right?
