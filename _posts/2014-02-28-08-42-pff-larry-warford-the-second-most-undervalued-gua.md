The praise keeps coming for Lions guard, Larry Warford.  PFF broke down values based on the [Jahnke Value Model](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2014/02/24/jahnke-value-model-primer/) and Warford had the second best differential in the entire NFL.  Good news for the Lions salary cap and bad news for the rest of the NFC North.
